                        2021 was so crazy for the moment that the <strong>candles also wanted to participate in the market
                        euphoria</strong>, the candlestick has broken his resistance, 13 000 candles managed to <strong>escaped the
                            cryptocurrency charts.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They came to us, we still donâ€™t know why, but we had to capture them for our safety. They told us
                        to do it. We had no choice. We have enclosed each of them in individual cards. <strong>We felt that some of
                        these candles contained a great power... stronger and more powerful than the others.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But before capturing them, they asked us one particular thing: to distribute them throught the world, so that 
                        each of them <strong>shares luck and equality.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It looks like the crypto universe is <strong>giving us a mission.</strong>
                    </p>
